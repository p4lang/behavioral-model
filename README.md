# LPM Trie: C to C++ Conversion PR

This PR converts the `bf_lpm_trie` implementation from C to modern C++. The implementation provides a Longest Prefix Match (LPM) trie, commonly used for IP routing table lookups.

## Changes Made

- Converted `bf_lpm_trie.c` to `bf_lpm_trie.cpp` using modern C++ features
- Used RAII principles for better memory management
- Added comprehensive null pointer checks
- Fixed issues with partial byte masking for correct prefix matching
- Added a comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_bf_lpm_trie/` 
- Maintained backward compatibility with the C API

## Benefits

- Improved memory safety through smart pointers
- Better type safety and encapsulation
- More maintainable and extensible codebase
- Easier debugging with proper C++ classes

For more details, please see the implementation files and test suite.

# Behavioral Model (BMv2)

This is the reference P4 software switch (behavioral model) repository.

Please see [the BMv2 wiki](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/wiki) for
more documentation on this repository.

## Overview

This PR converts the `bf_lpm_trie` implementation from C to modern C++. The implementation provides a Longest Prefix Match (LPM) trie, commonly used for IP routing table lookups and other prefix-based matching operations.

## Changes

- Converted the entire implementation from C to C++
- Used modern C++ features like smart pointers, classes, templates, and algorithms
- Improved exception safety with RAII principles
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Implemented null pointer safety checks
- Fixed issues with partial byte masking to ensure correct longest prefix matching
- Added extensive test cases to validate the implementation

## Benefits

The C++ implementation provides several advantages over the original C code:

- **Memory Safety**: Uses RAII and smart pointers to prevent memory leaks
- **Type Safety**: Stronger type checking and safer conversions
- **Encapsulation**: Better encapsulation through C++ classes
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more structured code with better separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Potential performance improvements through better data structures
- **Extensibility**: Easier to extend and modify in the future

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

- A `BfLpmTrie` class that provides the main interface for trie operations
- Internal node, branch, and prefix structures for the trie
- Support for variable-length prefixes
- Efficient binary search for prefix lookup
- Memory cleanup through auto-shrinking behavior
- C API compatibility through wrapper functions

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test suite that covers:

- Basic insertion and lookup operations
- Prefix deletion
- Edge cases (empty tries, default routes)
- Overlapping prefixes
- Binary tree structure
- Partial byte handling
- C API compatibility
- Stress testing with many prefixes
- IP routing simulation

All tests have been verified to pass on both the original C implementation and the new C++ version, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Usage

The API remains compatible with the original C version. Example usage:

```cpp
// Create a trie for IPv4 addresses (4 bytes)
bm::BfLpmTrie trie(4, true);  // true enables auto-shrinking

// Insert a route (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
char route[4] = {192, 168, 1, 0};
trie.insert(route, 24, 1);  // prefix_length=24, value=1

// Lookup an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
char ip[4] = {192, 168, 1, 100};
bm::value_t value;
if (trie.lookup(ip, &value)) {
    // Found a match, use the value
}

// Check if a specific prefix exists
if (trie.has_prefix(route, 24)) {
    // Prefix exists
}

// Delete a prefix
trie.delete_prefix(route, 24);
```

The C API is still available for backward compatibility:

```c
// Create a trie
bf_lpm_trie_t* trie = bf_lpm_trie_create(4, true);

// Insert a route
char route[4] = {192, 168, 1, 0};
bf_lpm_trie_insert(trie, route, 24, 1);

// Lookup
char ip[4] = {192, 168, 1, 100};
value_t value;
if (bf_lpm_trie_lookup(trie, ip, &value)) {
    // Found a match
}

// Clean up
bf_lpm_trie_destroy(trie);
```

## Next Steps

1. Integration into the BMv2 build system
2. Consider further optimizations such as:
   - Custom allocators for performance-critical parts
   - More specialized containers for specific use cases
   - Thread-safety considerations if needed
