/*  This program serves as an example for how to write a simple RPC service,
    using the request/reply pattern.  The server is just a single threaded
    for loop, which processes each request.  The requests run quickly enough
    that there is no need for parallelism.

    Our demonstration application layer protocol is simple.  The client sends
    a name, and the server replies with a greeting based on the time of day.
    The messages are sent in ASCII, and are not zero terminated.

    To run this program, start the server as rpc_demo <url> -s
    Then connect to it with the client as rpc_client <url> <name>.
    The client will print a timezone appropriate greeting, based on
    the time at the server.  For example:

    % ./rpc_demo tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 -s &
    % ./rpc_demo tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 Garrett
    Good morning, Garrett.
