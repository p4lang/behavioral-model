This directory contains the documentation for nanomsg library. To build the
documentation (both man pages and web pages) do "./configure --enable-doc" and
"make" in the build directory; man pages will be installed with "make install".
You must have asciidoctor installed.

The stylesheet.css file is taken from asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory, and
is the colony theme.
