nn_bus(7)
=========

NAME
----
nn_bus - message bus scalability protocol


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*#include <nanomsg/bus.h>*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Broadcasts messages from any node to all other nodes in the topology. The socket
should never receive messages that it sent itself.

This pattern scales only to local level (within a single machine or within
a single LAN). Trying to scale it further can result in overloading individual
nodes with messages.

WARNING: For bus topology to function correctly, user is responsible for
ensuring that path from each node to any other node exists within the topology.

Raw (AF_SP_RAW) BUS socket never sends the message to the peer it was received
from.

Socket Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~

NN_BUS::
    Sent messages are distributed to all nodes in the topology. Incoming
    messages from all other nodes in the topology are fair-queued in the
    socket.

Socket Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no options defined at the moment.
