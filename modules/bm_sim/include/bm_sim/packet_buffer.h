//! unparsed packet when the packet is first received 2) the packet payload
//! (i.e. data that was not extracted) while the packet is being processed by
//! the match-action tables 3) the deparsed packet ready to be transmitted.
//! As a target switch programmer, you will only encounter PacketBuffer when
//! creating a new Packet instance:
//! @code
//! // A new packet was received on port_num, its ingress length is len, we
//! // assign pkt_id as its packet id (and increment the counter for the next
//! // incoming packet). We provide a PacketBuffer with capacity 2048 and
//! // initialize it with the incoming packet data.
//! auto packet = new_packet_ptr(port_num, pkt_id++, len,
//!                              PacketBuffer(2048, buffer, len));

  //! actually copied to the end of the buffer. This is because while we never
  //! need to append data at the end of a packet, the header size of the
  //! outgoing packet may be larger than the header size of the incoming
  //! packet. By copying the initial \p data at the end of the buffer, we
  //! preserve space at the beginning of the buffer for potential new
  //! headers.
  //!
  //! The capacity \p size of the PacketBuffer needs to be at least as big as \p
  //! data_size. If new headers are going to be added to the pakcet during
  //! processing, \p size needs to be at least as big as the size of the
  //! outgoing packet.
