# CMake Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the CMake implementation for the behavioral-model project (issue #1254). The implementation provides a complete CMake build system that can be used as an alternative to the existing autotools build system.

## Files Created

1. **Top-level CMakeLists.txt**
   - Sets up the project, version, and C++ standard (C++17)
   - Defines build options that match the autotools configuration
   - Configures compiler flags and definitions
   - Finds required dependencies (Boost, GMP, PCAP, etc.)

2. **Directory-specific CMakeLists.txt files**
   - PI/CMakeLists.txt
   - include/CMakeLists.txt
   - pdfixed/CMakeLists.txt
   - services/CMakeLists.txt
   - src/BMI/CMakeLists.txt
   - src/CMakeLists.txt
   - src/bf_lpm_trie/CMakeLists.txt

   - third_party/jsoncpp/CMakeLists.txt
   - third_party/spdlog/CMakeLists.txt
   - thrift_src/CMakeLists.txt
   - tools/CMakeLists.txt

3. **CMake modules**
   - cmake/FindThrift.cmake
   - cmake/FindgRPC.cmake
   - cmake/GenerateThrift.cmake

4. **Configuration files**
   - include/bm/config.h.in

5. **Documentation**
   - README.cmake.md
   - Updated README.md with CMake build instructions

6. **CI support**
   - .github/workflows/cmake.yml

## Testing Required

The following tests should be performed to ensure the CMake build system works correctly:

1. **Basic Build Test**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

2. **Build with Different Options**
   ```bash
   # Test with Thrift disabled
   cmake -DWITH_THRIFT=OFF ..
   cmake --build .

   # Test with Nanomsg disabled
   cmake -DWITH_NANOMSG=OFF ..
   cmake --build .

   # Test with debugger enabled
   cmake -DENABLE_DEBUGGER=ON ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

3. **Run Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   cd build
   ctest
   ```

4. **Test Installation**
   ```bash
   cd build
   cmake --build . --target install
   ```

5. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Test on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora)
   - Test on macOS
   - Test on Windows (with MinGW or MSVC)

## Known Limitations and Future Work

1. **Platform-Specific Code**
   - Additional platform-specific checks may be needed, especially for Windows support.

2. **Installation Paths**
   - Installation paths may need to be adjusted to match the autotools build.

3. **Build Options**
   - Some build options from the autotools build may need further refinement.

## Conclusion

The CMake implementation provides a complete build system for the behavioral-model project. It supports all the same options as the autotools build and should work on all platforms supported by CMake. Testing is required to ensure that the implementation works correctly in all scenarios.
